This paper is a comparative evaluation of different ways to incorporate an image into an image caption generator neural network.

Works on both python 2 and python 3 (except for the MSCOCO evaluation toolkit which requires python 2).

Python dependencies (install all with pip):
  * theano
  * configparser
  * future
